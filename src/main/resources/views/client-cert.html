<p>Mutual TLS (where both the client and server have certificates that each validate) can be enabled
by setting the <code>withClientCertificateTrustManager(TrustManager)</code> setting on the
    {{ javadoc("io.muserver.HttpsConfigBuilder") | raw }}.</p>

<p>You may want to do this if you want to authenticate your users using certificates that you sign.</p>

<p>This page will describe one way of how client certificates can be created and signed which are subsequently validated by
mu-server. For information on setting up server-side TLS, see the <a href="/https">HTTPS config</a> documentation.</p>

<h2>High level overview</h2>

<p>You, the server owner, control who has access to your service by signing client certificates for clients. In
other words, you need to become your own certificate authority.</p>

<p>Clients that want to access your service create a certificate request, which you can then sign and return to the client.</p>

<p>When the client makes a call to your web service, they include their signed certificate with the request to the
HTTPS endpoint of your service. It is often referred to as &quot;mutual&quot; TLS because while the client
verifies the TLS certificate of the server (as is normal for any HTTPS request) the server also verifies the
certificate sent by the client was signed by your certificate authority.</p>

<p>Assuming the certificate is valid, then the server can assume that the client is who they say they are (or, like
any secret-based authentication scheme, the client may be an attacker who has stolen the legitimate client's certificate).</p>

<p>The next section shows how to create a Certificate Authority, generate and sign client certificates, and make
it work with mu-server.</p>

<h2>Step by step instructions</h2>

<p>First you need to create a Certificate Authority key and certificate which will let you sign certificates and
then later verify that if was you that signed the certificate. One way to do this is using <code>openssl</code>
from the command line. The following will create files called <code>ca.key</code>, <code>ca.cert</code> and <code>ca.p12</code>.
Anyone with these files will be able to generate client certificates on your behalf so these must be stored securely.</p>

<pre class="bash"><code>openssl req -newkey rsa:4096 -keyform PEM -keyout ca.key -x509 -days 3650 -outform PEM -out ca.cer</code></pre>

<p>The pass phrase entered on the first step will be needed in the next step and in the future when certificates are signed. Next step
is to convert the certificate to PKCS12 format so that we can easily load it in Java.</p>

<pre><code>openssl pkcs12 -export -inkey ca.key -in ca.cer -out ca.p12</code></pre>

<p>You may be asked for a pass phrase for <code>ca.key</code> (which you created in step one) and then for another
password which will be the password for the <code>PKCS12</code> file. In this example, <code>password</code> was
used for both.</p>

<p>We now need a mu-server created that loads this certificate into a <code>javax.net.ssl.TrustManager</code>
object so that client certificates can be verified. Assuming the files are on the classpath, the following
example creates the Trust Manager, passes it to the HTTPS config builder, and starts the server with a
single handler that inspects the certificate.</p>

{{ source("ClientCert.java") | raw }}

<p>We now have a server that can verify and inspect client certificates.</p>

<h2>Creating a client certificate</h2>

<p>This is a two-step process:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Create a certificate signing request - this should be performed by the client</li>
    <li>Sign the request with the certificate authority store</li>
</ol>


<h3>Create a request</h3>

<p>The following command will create a private key that the client should keep secret:</p>

<pre class="bash"><code>openssl genrsa -out client.key 4096</code></pre>

<p>The following creates a certificate request using that key:</p>

<pre class="bash"><code>openssl req -new -key client.key -out client.req</code></pre>

<p>Only the <code>client.req</code> file should be shared with the service owner for them to sign.</p>

<h3>Sign the request</h3>

<p>The client should send <code>client.req</code> to the service owner. You can now use your
<code>ca.cer</code> and <code>ca.key</code> files to create a signed certificate <code>client.cer</code>
which they pass back to the client.</p>

<pre class="bash"><code>openssl x509 -req -in client.req -CA ca.cer -CAkey ca.key -set_serial 101 -extensions client -days 365 -outform PEM -out client.cer</code></pre>

<p>If the client wants the certificate in PKCS12 format, it can be converted to create <code>client.p12</code>:</p>

<pre class="bash"><code>openssl pkcs12 -export -inkey client.key -in client.cer -out client.p12</code></pre>

<h2>Send requests with the certificate</h2>

<p>This is outside of the scope of this article as every client may do this differently. In general though, if
<code>client.p12</code> is registered with the user's browser then the browser can send the certificate with the
request.</p>

<p>For a Java example where OkHttpClient is used, you can refer to
    <a href="https://github.com/3redronin/mu-server/blob/master/src/test/java/io/muserver/ClientCertTest.java">Mu Server's client cert test</a>
which creates a client that uses a p12 certificate to make requests with.</p>

<p>In the following example on Windows, the <code>client.p12</code> certificate was double-clicked on to register
it in the Windows certificate store, and when loading the above server code the browser asks which certificate
to send:</p>

<p>The handler in the example above can then access various properties from the certificate which has been verified
as being signed by the server's certificate authority:</p>
