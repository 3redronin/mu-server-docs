<p>In the most simple case, you simply want to serve the contents of a directory:</p>

{{ source("ResourceHandling.java") | raw }}

<p>Or if you have bundled some static data into an uber jar, you'll want to serve it from the classpath:</p>

<pre><code class="language-java">ResourceHandlerBuilder.classpathHandler("/web")</code></pre>

<p>Or perhaps you want to serve from a local path during development and from the classpath when running as an uber jar.
    In this case, the following builder can be used:</p>

<pre><code class="language-java">ResourceHandlerBuilder.fileOrClasspath("src/main/resources/web", "/web")</code></pre>

<p>This means: "if there is a directory called <code>src/main/resources/web</code> then use that, otherwise load from
    <code>/web</code> on the classpath".</p>

<h2>Paths</h2>

<p>If you wish to serve the files from another path, you can add a resource handler to a
{{ javadoc("io.muserver.ContextHandlerBuilder") | raw }}. The following would server all resources from
the <code>/web</code> classpath path on the <code>/static/</code> path:</p>

{{ source("ResourceHandlingWithContext.java") | raw }}

<p>See <a href="/contexts">more info about contexts</a>.</p>

<h2>Mime Types and Headers</h2>

<p>Mu Server comes with some opinionated response headers. For example, Javascript and CSS files are served with
a short-lived cache value, while HTML pages have no cache, and most text files are served with <code>utf-8</code>
encoding.</p>

<p>You can browse the <a href="/resources/mime-types">full list of mime types and headers</a>.</p>

<p>To customize response headers on a request-by-request basis, a {{ javadoc("io.muserver.handlers.ResourceCustomizer") | raw }}
can be used. For example, if you have a convention that any javascript files that end with the extension <code>.immutable.js</code>
should never be downloaded twice, then you can set an aggressive cache control header for these files like so:</p>

{{ source("ResourceHandlingWithCustomization.java") | raw }}

<p>You can also customize headers based on file extensions. For example, perhaps you have <code>.dan</code> files
that do not have any mime type or headers configured by default. To set custom headers for <code>.dan</code> files,
you would use the following code:</p>

{{ source("ResourceMimeTypes.java") | raw }}

<p>You can try downloading a .dan file and viewing the response headers here: <a href="/dan-file.dan">/dan-file.dan</a></p>

<h2>More details</h2>

<p>Range requests are enabled for all resource downloads. This allows for resumable downloads and seeking
while streaming audio and video files.</p>

<p>See the {{ javadoc("io.muserver.handlers.ResourceHandlerBuilder") | raw }} JavaDoc for more options.</p>
