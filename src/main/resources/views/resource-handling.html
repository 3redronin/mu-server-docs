<p>In the most simple case, you simply want to serve the contents of a directory:</p>

{{ source("ResourceHandling.java") | raw }}

<p>Or if you have bundled some static data into an uber jar, you'll want to serve it from the classpath:</p>

<pre><code class="language-java">ResourceHandlerBuilder.classpathHandler("/web")</code></pre>

<p>Or perhaps you want to serve from a local path during development and from the classpath when running as an uber jar.
    In this case, the following builder can be used:</p>

<pre><code class="language-java">ResourceHandlerBuilder.fileOrClasspath("src/main/resources/web", "/web")</code></pre>

<p>This means: "if there is a directory called <code>src/main/resources/web</code> then use that, otherwise load from
    <code>/web</code> on the classpath".</p>

<h2>Mime Types and Headers</h2>

<p>Mu Server comes with some opinionated response headers. For example, Javascript and CSS files are served with
a short-lived cache value, while HTML pages have no cache.</p>

<p>You can browse the <a href="/resources/mime-types">full list of mime types and headers</a>.</p>

<p>You can also customize headers based on file extensions. For example, perhaps you have <code>.dan</code> files
that do not have any mime type or headers configured by default. To set custom headers for <code>.dan</code> files,
you would use the following code:</p>

{{ source("ResourceMimeTypes.java") | raw }}

<p>You can try downloading a .dan file and viewing the response headers here: <a href="/dan-file.dan">/dan-file.dan</a></p>

<p>See the {{ javadoc("io.muserver.handlers.ResourceHandlerBuilder") | raw }} JavaDoc for more options.</p>
