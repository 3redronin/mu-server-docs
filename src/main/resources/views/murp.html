<p>A reverse proxy simply receives requests from a client and forwards them to another
    server. If you need to proxy requests to other serves, then you may consider using
    <a href="https://github.com/3redronin/murp">Murp: the Mu Reverse Proxy</a> which is described below.</p>

<h2>Step one: add the Murp dependency</h2>

<pre><code class="language-markup">&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;io.muserver&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;mu-server&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;{{version}}&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;
&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;io.muserver&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;murp&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;{{murpversion}}&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;</code></pre>

<p><strong>Warning:</strong> Murp has a dependency on Jetty Client which brings in some Jetty
    dependencies. If your project already has direct or indirect dependencies on Jetty, check
    that the versions of the <code>jetty-*</code> libraries are all the same version.</p>

<h2>Step two: create a Mu Server and add the reverse proxy as a handler</h2>

<p>Murp does not start a server for you, instead you need to create your own server which allows you to configure
    it however you want (e.g. with HTTPS). The reverse proxy is just added like any other handler, which means you
    can add handlers before it (perhaps to add or remove custom headers) or after it (if the URI mapping function
    returns <code>null</code> then the next handler will be invoked).</p>

<p>The reverse proxy is configured with the {{ javadoc("io.muserver.murp.ReverseProxyBuilder") | raw }} which has
    only one required configuration option: <code>withUriMapper</code> which takes a {{
    javadoc("io.muserver.murp.UriMapper") | raw }}.
    The URI mapper is how you convert an incoming request URI to the target URI.</p>

<p>In the following example, a target server is started on HTTP which simply replies with the requested URI and headers.
    The reverse proxy is started on HTTPS and just blindly forwards all requests to the target server.</p>

{{ source("ReverseProxyExample.java") | raw }}

<p>Note that further customization of the proxied request and response can be done by adding listeners before the
request is sent to the target with <code class="language-java">ReverseProxyBuilder.withRequestInterceptor(RequestInterceptor)</code> and before the response
is sent to the client with <code class="language-java">ReverseProxyBuilder.withResponseInterceptor(ResponseInterceptor)</code>.</p>

<h3 id="hostheader">The Host header</h3>

<p>There are certain headers that reverse proxies do not forward, called <em>Hop by Hop Headers</em>.
    However, by default the <code>Host</code> header is supposed to be proxied from the client to
    the target server, which is the default in Murp.</p>

<p>However if proxying requests from the browser to another HTTPS website, you may get
    errors related to invalid Host headers, or related to SNI. This is because the Host
    header does not match the header that the target website matches.</p>

<p>In these cases, you can instruct Murp to <strong>not</strong> forward the <code>Host</code>
    header by calling <code>.proxyHostHeader(false)</code> on the ReverseProxyBuilder.</p>

<h3>Timeouts</h3>

<p>There are several types of time outs when working with reverse proxies:</p>

<ul>
    <li><em>Name resolution</em> - the lookup of the address of the target domain name</li>
    <li><em>Connection timeout</em> - the time taken to establish a connection to the target</li>
    <li><em>Idle timeout</em> - after the response has started, this is the amount of time allowed without receiving
        any bytes from the target. Because there is no way to reliably detect disconnections over HTTP, this value
        is needed to kill zombie connections.
    </li>
    <li><em>Total timeout</em> - the maximum allowed time of the full response.</li>
</ul>

<p>All of these except the total timeout are defined on the HTTP client. The following example shows
how to configure each of them:</p>

{{ source("ReverseProxyTimeoutsExample.java") | raw }}

<p>If a timeout occurs before any headers are sent back to the client, then a <code>504</code> status code is sent to the client.</p>
