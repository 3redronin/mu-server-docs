<p>Mu Server optionally provides non-blocking reading of requests and writing of responses. Any handler
    can become an async handler by invoking the following method which returns a
    {{ javadoc("io.muserver.AsyncHandle") | raw }}:</p>

<pre><code class="language-java">AsyncHandle handle = request.handleAsync();</code></pre>

<p>Calling the <code>complete()</code> method on that handle marks the response as complete.</p>

<h2>Writing responses asynchronously</h2>

<p>With an <code>AsyncHandle</code>, you can write byte buffers using one of two non-blocking methods,
    depending on whether you prefer a future or a callback to be notified when the write has completed:</p>

<ul>
    <li><code>Future&lt;Void&gt; write(ByteBuffer data)</code></li>
    <li><code>void write(ByteBuffer data, DoneCallback callback)</code></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Tip:</strong> to convert a string to a ByteBuffer, use
    <code class="language-java">Mutils.toByteBuffer(String)</code></p>

<p>In the following example, when a request for a JPG is made, the file is opened and segments of the file
    are read asynchronously. When some bytes are read from the file, they are passed on to the response. The
    <code>write</code> method with the {{ javadoc("io.muserver.DoneCallback") | raw }} is used so that after
    the bytes from the byte-buffer have been written to the response, another request to read more data is made.</p>

{{ source("AsyncWritingExample.java") | raw }}

<p><strong>Note:</strong> the file handler described on the <a href="/resources">static resources</a> page is
    uses the above approach so it's recommended you use that if you need to serve files.</p>

<h2 id="request-body">Reading request bodies asynchronously</h2>

<p>If you expect a request body, it can be read asynchronously by adding a
    {{ javadoc("io.muserver.RequestBodyListener") | raw }} with the AsyncHandle's
    <code>setReadListener</code> method:</p>

{{ source("AsyncRequestBodyExample.java") | raw }}

<p>Note that if you do not need non-blocking request reading, the <a href="/model#requests">blocking
    request body readers</a> can still be used by async handlers.</p>
