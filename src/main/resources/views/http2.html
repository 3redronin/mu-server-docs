<p>HTTP/2 is supported for Java 9 and above. It is off by default, but can be turned on with the
    {{ javadoc("io.muserver.Http2ConfigBuilder") | raw }} class. The <code>http2EnabledIfAvailable()</code>
    method can be used to detect if Java 9 or later is in use, in which case it will be enabled.</p>

{{ source("Http2Example.java") | raw }}

<p>Note that HTTP/2 is only supported on HTTPS.</p>
